			<h1>Essay</h1>
			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>BoardGameGeek.com is a great website for users interested in finding new board games. It has a library of over 18,000 board games and user 
			generated reviews and ratings for each game. Approximately 15 million user reviews were aggregated to put this data set together. For ease of 
			use and to reduce load time, I decided to focus only on the top 500 ranked board games. My data is sourced from 
			<a href='https://www.kaggle.com/jvanelteren/boardgamegeek-reviews' target='_blank'>Kaggle</a>. </p>

			<h2>Messaging</h2>
			<p>The message I am trying to communicate with my narrative visualization is on the relationship between the category of the board game 
			(i.e. strategy, party, family, etc.) and its number of reviews, average rating, quartile ranking, star rating, and actual purchase volumes. 
			I want users to understand that the highest rated board games are mostly strategy games, and that people tend to rate games harshly. Of the
			 500 top ranked board games, only 80 received 4 star reviews, and of those 80 games, 73% were strategy games. Additionally, high ratings do 
			 not necessarily correlate with high purchase volume.</p>

			<h2>Narrative Structure</h2>
			<p>My narrative visualization is structured as an interactive slideshow. Each of the scenes in the slideshow can be viewed by clicking on a 
			button (i.e. Reviews by Category, Reviews by Star Ratings, etc.) which directs the user to the next scene. In any one of the scenes, users 
			can hover over data points to learn more about a game (name, rank, category, description, etc.).</p>

			<h2>Visual Structure</h2>
			<p>The first section uses a bubble chart to depict each of the top rated games as a single color coded bubble. The color coding by 
			category is kept consistent throughout the visualization so users can easily track the movement of bubbles across the scene. There 
			are four buttons which are used to help a user navigate through the slideshow, as each button is clicked, the bubbles move into various 
			areas on the screen. By moving the same set of 500 bubbles across the scene a user can easily track bubbles and notice patterns in the data.</p>

			<h2>Scenes</h2>
			<p>The first scene is the “All Reviews” scene which gives a high level overview of all of the data in the game dataset. The area of each game’s 
			circle is determined by its number of reviews. The next scene is the “Reviews by Category” scene which splits the bubbles into five categories, 
			Family, Strategy, Thematic, Party, and Uncategorized. I placed this scene second so that users understand how large the Strategy set is, and so 
			they understand the color coding of the data set. The third scene breaks down the data into quartiles, so users can see the highest ranked games 
			(Q1) and compare to other quartiles. Users should notice that most of Q1 is Strategy. The last scene is “Reviews by Star ratings” which further 
			illustrates how the highest rated games are strategy games and that people seldom give even the highest rated games high reviews. The graph below 
			allows a user to examine games by purchase data and category so that users can again see how category seems to correlate with popularity and 
			purchases. Users can manipulate the graph to examine short games and long games (games longer than 2 hours).</p>

			<h2>Annotations</h2>
			<p>The annotations are bright green so that they are easily visible and stand out to the viewer. Each annotation has a title and a detailed 
			comment below which provides more information. The annotations do not change within a single scene. Each of the annotations comments on the 
			popularity of strategy games in the data set since that is the main message of this set.</p>

			<h2>Parameters and Triggers</h2>
			<p>Each of the parameters are defined by the scene the user is viewing. For the overview scene of the bubble chart visualization, 
			parameters for the x,y coordinates of each bubble are set to an initial central position for the All Reviews Visualization. As a user 
			clicks one of the buttons to view another scene, it triggers the change of the bubble’s x,y coordinates. For example, each of the categories 
			in Reviews by Category has a different central x,y position for its group of bubbles. In the bar chart presentation, the data set is split 
			into short (less than 2 hr) and long (more than 2 hr) games. Users may select from a dropdown to focus only on short or long term games, These parameters are 
			triggered to be updated as mouseover tooltips as well as the dropdown selection for short and long games. Also, clicking on the sort button triggers 
			the movement of the bars in order from greatest to smallest.</p>

			<h1>Overall Finding</h1>
			<p> The high-level overall view shows that there is a negative correlation between the number of published application verses the
			level of content restriction. In other words, as the application is available to a wider range of users in different ages, then the restriction
			is more linient, thus there are more author publishing to the Google Play Store </p>
			<h2>Customer Rating against Content Rating</h2>
			<p>As the distribution shows regarding customer rating (sclred from 1 to 5), as the application is more restricted to mature people, the
			average customer rating tends to be lower. On the contrary side, when the application contains fewer restrited content, the review is less controversial
			and most people opt to rate 3 or 4 stars</p>
			<h2>Prices and Number of Installations</h2>
			<p>As we partition the number of free applications and the number of paid applications, such as the seperation in Google Play Store, we found
				that there are more applications with age restriction. In particular, most of the free application are welcomed to all age people, while
				the proportion of age restricted applications takes a greater occupation for paid Apps in terms of number of isntallations</p>
